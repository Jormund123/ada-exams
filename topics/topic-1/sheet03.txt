Exercise 3.1  Shortest paths in acyclic graphs (5 Points)
Let G = (V,E) be an acyclic weighted directed graph and let s,t ∈ V . Give an algorithm that calculates a
shortest (s,t)-path in linear time (O(n + m)) and show that it is correct.
Hint: Pick a smart processing order
Exercise 3.2  Edge centrality (5 Points)
Let G = (V,E) be a directed connected weighted graph. For an edge e ∈ E we can dene σst (e) to be the
number of shortest paths from s to t that contain the edge e . With this denition we can also dene the
betweenness centrality and the stress centrality of an edge:
CB(e) = X
s ,t
σst (e)
σst
CS(e) = X
s ,t
σst (e)
a) Show that CS(v ) and CS(e) can be related by the following formula (2.5p) :
CS(v ) = 1

b) Show that CB(v ) and CB(e) can be related by the following formula (2.5p) :
CB(v ) =

Note that d(v ) are all edges that are incident to v , d
+(v ) are all outgoing edges of v and d
−(v ) are all
incoming edges of v .
Exercise 3.3  Brandes algorithm with edge betweenness (5 Points)
Adapt Brandes algorithm in such a way, that it collects all of the edge betweenness values.

Exercise 3.4  Betweenness, closeness and center of a tree (5 Points)
Let n1,n2 ∈ N>0. We dene the following fan graph F (n1,n2) = (V,E) with
V = {a,b,c, v1, . . . , vn1
, w1, . . . , wn2 } ,
E = {{a,b},{b,c}} ∪ {{a,vi} : 1 ≤ i ≤ n1} ∪ {{c,wi} : 1 ≤ i ≤ n2} .
You can nd an illustration of F (3,2) below.

a) Calculate the closeness centrality of all nodes with respect to n1 and n2.
b) Calculate the betweenness centrality of all nodes with respect to n1 and n2.
c) State conditions for n1 and n2 which guarantee that either a,b or c has maximal closeness.
d) State conditions for n1 and n2 which guarantee that either a,b or c has maximal betweenness.
e) Which vertex is in the center C as dened on the previous exercise sheet? Conclude that a central
vertex must not have maximal betweenness or maximal closeness.
