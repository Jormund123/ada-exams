Introduction Motivation
Motivation: Rational Drug Design
Which molecules are active against disease X?
Which molecules have a similar function/effect? (Reduction of side
effects)
Which molecules may have an increased effectiveness?
High-throughput screening for promising candidates
Molecules can be modelled as graphs with attributes
Direct relationship between structure and effects
→ Graph similarity

Introduction Motivation
Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects such that objects in the
same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than objects in
different groups.
many possibilities for formal definition
studied for a long time (statistics, data bases, machine learning)
recently also in TCS (e.g., data streams)
useful for data sparsification and sampling approaches → big data
popular approaches: distance-based, centroid-based (k-Means)

Introduction Motivation
Classification (Supervised Learning)
Given: Training set with labelled items (classes).
Goal: Train a classifier so that a new item will be assigned to its correct
class.
many variations (decisions, predictions)
discrete labels: mostly studied in ML community
continuous labels: regression mostly studied in statistics
popular approaches: SVMs (kernel), deep learning, k-NN, logistic
regression, Bayes classifiers, decision tree method, clustering

Introduction Motivation
Association Pattern Mining
Goal: find inherent regularities in the data
Frequent pattern mining: find frequent items (occuring at least minimum
support times)
Association pattern mining: generalization also based on association rules
widely studied in data mining
useful for deriving similarity measures on data sets
useful for clustering, classification, outlier detection

Introduction Motivation
Outlier Detection
Find data items that are different from the majority of the given data.
outlier may reflect errors in the data or belong to rare events
methods: statistical tests, models based on spatial proximity (k-NN),
density-based methods, ...
methods: clustering, classification, association pattern mining

Introduction Motivation
When are two graphs identical? Graph Isomorphism
Definition
Let G = (VG , EG ) and H = (VH, EH) be simple graphs. A bijective
mapping π : VG → VH is called graph isomorphism if the following holds:
∀ v,w ∈ VG : (v,w) ∈ EG ⇐⇒ (π(v), π(w)) ∈ EH
G H

Graph Isomorphism
Definition
Let G = (VG , EG ) and H = (VH, EH) be simple graphs. A bijective
mapping π : VG → VH is called graph isomorphism if the following holds:
∀ v,w ∈ VG : (v,w) ∈ EG ⇐⇒ (π(v), π(w)) ∈ EH
G H
Two graphs are called isomorphic (G1 ≃ G2), if a graph isomorphism
exists.

Introduction Motivation
Graph Isomorphism Problem
Definition (Graph Isomorphism Problem)
Given: simple graphs G and H
Find: Is G isomorphic to H, i.e., G ≃ H?
Remarks:
If graphs have vertex and/or edge labels or attributes, definition will
be extended to the labels (various possibilities)
Complexity: OPEN
Quasipolynomial algorithm: n
(log n)
O(1) [Babai 2015/17]
Practice: mostly solvable very fast
