Exercise 5.1 – Equitable partitions (3 Points)
Remember that a partition C = {C1, . . . ,Cℓ} of G is equitable if for every pair of vertices u,v ∈ V belonging
to the same cell Ci of the partition, and for every cell R ∈ {C1, . . . ,Cℓ}, it holds |N(u) ∩ R| = |N(v ) ∩ R|.
Show that a partition C = {C1, . . . ,Cℓ} is equitable if and only if for i,j ∈ [ℓ] it holds that
(i) the induced subgraph of each Ci
is regular, and
(ii) the induced bipartite graph in between Ci and Cj
is biregular, i.e., the vertices in Ci all have the same
degree di
, and the vertices in Cj all have the same degree dj
. (3p)
Exercise 5.2 – Weisfeiler-Leman: Example (5 Points)
Apply the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on the following graph. For every iteration and every vertex, give
the color histogram of its neighbors from the previous iteration. Further, give the queue from the Grohe
algorihm (slide 21).

Exercise 5.3 – Weisfeiler-Leman on paths (2 Points)
We now discuss the number of refinement (see slide 21) iterations of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on
paths. Let P = (V,E) be a path with |V | = n vertices. How many iterations does the WL algorithm need
to compute the stable partition of the vertices? Prove your answers.
Exercise 5.4 – Weisfeiler-Leman and isomorphisms (3 Points)
Let G and H be two isomorphic graphs. Prove that the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm generates the same
color groups for G and H.

Exercise 5.5 – An algorithm for stress centrality (7 Points)
The stress centrality of a node v is given by
CS(v ) = X
s̸=v̸=t∈V
σst (v ).
a) Construct an algorithm that calculates the stress centrality for every node in an unweighted undirected
graph in O (nm) time and O (n + m) space and also argue that it is correct. (5p)
Hint: Adapt Brandes algorithm
b) Explain how to adapt the algorithm so that it runs on trees in O (n) time and space. (2p)
