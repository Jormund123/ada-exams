Introduction Geometric Interpretation
Feasibility Region of an LP
Definitions
A variable assignment x = (xj) corresponds to a point in the n-dimensional
space R
n
.
Every constraint a
T
i
x ≤ bi defines a half-space. The boundary of this
half-space is the hyperplane a
T
i
x = bi
.
The half-space consists of all the points on one side including the points on
the hyperplane.
The intersection of the half-spaces of all the constraints is called the region
of feasibility and defines the set of feasible solutions.
The intersection of a finite number of half-spaces is called a polyhedron P.
Bounded polyedrons are called polytopes.
The set of points formed by the polyhedron is convex, i.e., for all x, y ∈ P
all the points on the connecting line between x and y are in P.

Introduction Geometric Interpretation
Geometric Interpretation for Example with n = 2
Every constraint defines a half-space. E.g., the boundary of the first
constraint is the linear equation 2x + y = 3. The corresponding half-space
is the set of all points above the blue line (in the figure restricted to the
positive orthant). The same is true for the red and the green constraint.
The intersection of these 5 half-spaces forms the feasibility region.

Geometric Interpretation for n = 3
Each of the six contraints defines a half-space. The feasibility region is
exactly the intersection of all these half-spaces and forms a polyhedron
(here: even a polytope).

Objective Function of LPs
Definitions
The objective function z(x) = c
T x provides a direction in R
n
. We can
visualize this direction by a ray starting at the origin and passing through
the point c.
Let H be a hyperplane which is orthogonal to the ray of the objective
function, i.e., there exists a value z ∈ R, so that H = {x ∈ R
n
| c
T x = z}.
All points on H have the same objective value z, which we call z(H).

Introduction Properties of LPs
Bounded vs. Unbounded LPs
Definitions
An LP whose objective value z(x) is bounded from above by the constraints
in maximization problems (bounded from below for minimization problems),
is called bounded LP.
Otherwise it is called unbounded.

Introduction Properties of LPs
Vertex Solutions of an LP
Definition
Each set of n linearly independent hyperplanes intersect at a point.
Intersections contained in the solution polyhedron P are called the vertices
(or corner points) of P.
Two vertices are adjacent if they have exactly n − 1 hyperplanes in common.
Adjacent vertices are connected by an edge. The edge corresponds to the
intersection of the n − 1 common hyperplanes of these vertices.

Optimal Solutions of an LP
Given a bounded LP in the form max{c
T x | Ax ≤ b, x ≥ 0} with objective
function z and solution polyhedron P. Let H be a hyperplane orthogonal to
z and intersecting P.
We imagine H is shifted upwards (i.e. in the direction of the objective
function). This causes z(H) to increase continuously.
We shift H exactly so far that no point in P is above H any more. Let H
∗ be
the hyperplane obtained in this way. Then H
∗ ∩ P contains the optimal
solutions of the LP.
Because of convexity, at least one of these points is a vertex of P.
So exists always a vertex in P with optimal target value.

Introduction Properties of LPs
Search for Optimal Solutions of an LP
Definition
Let v be any vertex of the polyhedron P. Let Hv be the hyperplane
orthogonal to z passing through v. Let e be one of the edges incident to v.
If e runs above Hv , the target value improves when starting from v and
running along e. Such an edge is called improving edge.
If v has no improving edge, we cannot move Hv upward without leaving P
(because of convexity). So Hv = H
∗
and therefore v is optimal.
Here, the global optimum corresponds to a locally optimal vertex.

Introduction Properties of LPs
Altogether:
Theorem
For each bounded LP of the form max{c
T x | Ax ≤ b, x ≥ 0} with
feasibility region P there is at least one vertex of P with the optimal
solution value (the optimal vertex).
A vertex without improving incident edge is an optimal vertex.

Introduction Properties of LPs
Feasibility Region of an LP
Cases for LP feasibility region
For the feasibility region of a linear program max{c
T x | Ax ≤ b, x ≥ 0}
there are three cases:
P = ∅: no feasible solution exists ⇒ LP is unsolvable
P ̸= ∅ and max{c
T x | x ∈ P} does not exist: LP is solvable but there
does not exist an optimal solution
P ̸= ∅ and max{c
T x | x ∈ P} exists: LP is solvable and has a finite
solution x
∗ with c
T x
∗ = max{c
T x | x ∈ P}.

Introduction The Simplex Algorithm
Simplex Algorithm
Given: LP with polyhedron of feasible solutions P
1 Calculate an arbitrary vertex (inital vertex) v of P.
2 If there exists no improving edge incident to v ⇒ stop: v is optimal.
3 Traverse an arbitrary improving edge e incident to v.
4 If e is unbounded, i.e., it does not have another end point ⇒ stop:
The LP is unbounded.
5 Let u be the other end point of e. Let v = u. ⇒ goto (2)
