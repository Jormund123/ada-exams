Representations of Polyhedra
Definition (Polyhedron)
A subset P ⊆ R
n
is called a polyhedron, if there exists a matrix A ∈ R
(m,n)
and a vector b ∈ R
m with P = {x ∈ R
n
| Ax ≤ b}.
Observation
Every polyhedron P ̸= R
n
is the intersection of finitely many half spaces.
Definition (Polytope)
A polytope is a bounded polyhedron: P ⊆ {x ∈ R
n
| ||x||∞ ≤ B} for a
constant B > 0.

Linear Combinations
Definition
For x1, x2, . . . , xk ∈ R
n
and λ
T = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λk ) ∈ R
k
the vector
x =
X
k
i=1
λi xi
is a linear combination of x1, x2, . . . , xk .
If additionally λ ≥ 0, then x is a conic combination of x1, x2, . . . , xk .
If additionally λ ≥ 0 and Pk
i=1 λi = 1, then x is a convex
combination of x1, x2, . . . , xk .
The set of all vectors that can be represented as the corresponding
combination of finitely many vectors from S (∅ ̸= S ⊆ R
n
) are called
lin(S) (linear hull), cone(S) (conic hull) bzw. conv(S) (convex hull).

Representations of Polyhedra
Theorem 1 (Minkowski 1896, Weyl 1935) [without proof]
Every polyhedron P ∈ R
n
can be represented in the form
P = conv(V) + cone(E), where V und E are finite subsets of R
n
and vice
versa.
Therefore, we always have two representations of polyhedra:
P = {x ∈ R
n
| Ax ≤ b} = conv(V) + cone(E)
Polytopes can be represented by P = conv(V).

Theorem 2
Any combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated as a Binary
Linear Program (BLP) and vice versa.
Preliminaries for proof:
Definition
For a finite set E and F ⊆ E, the characteristic vector χ
F ∈ {0, 1}
E
for F and e ∈ E is defined as χ
F
e = 1 ⇔ e ∈ F.
To each element e ∈ E we associate a component of the vectors χ
F
,
and vice versa:
every 0/1-vector x ∈ {0, 1}
E
is a characteristic vector of a subset Fx
of E, and we have: Fx = {e ∈ E | xe = 1}.

Proof of Theorem 2
“⇐”: Given a BLP: max{c
T x | Ax ≤ b, x ∈ {0, 1}
n}:
The associated combinatorial optimization problem is:
E = {1, 2, . . . , n}
I = {Fx ⊆ E | x ∈ {0, 1}
E
, Ax ≤ b}
c(Fx ) = c
T χ
Fx
“⇒”: Given a combinatorial optimization problem: (E, I, c).
The associated BLP is:
max{c
T
x | x ∈ PF } with PF = conv{χ
F ∈ {0, 1}
E
| F ∈ I }
Every polyhedron has a representation by inequalities.

Proof fff
We have even shown something stronger:
Theorem 3
Every combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated as a Linear
Program.
However, the following problems occur with such an LP formulation:
calculation of the LP representation not possible in polynomial time
it may have exponentially many inequalities
inequalities have coefficients of exponential size

Definition
For W ⊆ V δ(W ) is called the cut of W : the set of all edges (w, v) ∈ E
incident to w ∈ W with endpoint v ∈ V \ W .
Feasible set: Set of all spanning subgraphs → Minimization takes care of
possible cycles

If one omits the integer conditions, then one generally obtains
fractional (i.e. non-integral) solutions.
However, the complete description of the polytope of all spanning
trees of a graph G is known.

Complete LP Characterizations
Complete LP Characterizations
Such complete LP characterizations of combinatorial optimization
problems by linear programs are rarely known,
e.g. for optimization problems like MST or largest forests or minimum
weight perfect matchings or also for special classes of graphs for more
general problems, like bipartite graphs.
However, if these are known, then they offer helpful alternative
(polynomial) solution methods (as opposed to purely combinatorial
algorithms) for the respective optimization problems and also their
variants.

Incomplete LP Characterizations
Incomplete LP Characterizations
Incomplete LP characterizations, such as LP relaxations (arise from
ILPs by deleting the integer constraints) are also useful for solving
optimization problems in practice.
For example, you can use these to design good
cutting plane algorithms
exact Branch-and-Bound algorithms
exact Branch-and-Cut algorithms
approximation algorithms
randomized algorithms

Conclusion
COPs as ILPs
Every combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated as a
Binary Linear Program (BLP)
Integer Linear Programs (ILP) are NP-hard...
COPs as LPs
Every combinatorial optimization problem can even be formulated as
a Linear Program (LP).
However, in general, this description cannot be calculated in
polynomial time and may also be exponentially large.
LPs can be solved in polynomial time.
