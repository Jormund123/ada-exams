Solution Methods of ILPs
NP-completeness does not mean:
that problem instances are unsolvable
that only heuristics/approximation algorithms can be applied
that the calculation of the optimal solution must have a long runtime
Exact solution methods of BLPs
Branch-and-Bound
Branch-and-Bound for LP-Relaxations

Branch-and-Bound
Idea: A special form of restricted enumeration based on the divide &
conquer principle.
Early exclusion of entire solution groups in enumeration through
bounding.
We say
L is a lower bound for an instance P of an optimization problem if
copt(P) ≥ L holds for the optimal solution value.
U is an upper bound if copt(P) ≤ U holds.

Branch-and-Bound for a Minimization Problem
Idea: A special form of restricted enumeration based on the divide &
conquer principle.
At each node of the emerging search tree, it is checked whether the
associated partial solution x
′ must be pursued further.
For this purpose, a lower bound L of the partial solution and an upper
bound U are calculated at each node.
U (for minimization problems) is called the primal bound and can be
calculated with any heuristic (e.g. Greedy).
L (for minimization problems) is called the dual bound and gives a
bound for the best value that can be achieved by x
′
.

Framework for Branch-and-Bound
Assumption: Minimization problem
Calculate a feasible initial solution with value U and a lower bound L
for all possible solutions.
If (U == L) → STOP: the solution found is optimal.
Branching: Partition the solution set (into two or more subproblems).
Search: Select one of the subproblems generated so far.
Bounding: Calculate an upper bound Ui and a lower bound Li
for
one of these subsets Ti
. Let U := min(U,Ui) be the value of the best
solution found so far. If Li ≥ U, the partial solutions in the subset Ti
need not be considered further.

LP-Relaxations
Definition LP-Relaxation
The LP that results from deleting the integer constraints from an ILP (and
adding the trivial inequalities instead).
Observation
The solution of an LP relaxation provides a so-called dual bound for
the optimal ILP value.
For minimization problems → lower bound
For maximization problems → upper bound
The solution vector x
′
corresponding to L may not be integral and
therefore not feasible for the ILP
If x
′
is integral ⇒ optimal for ILP

If the solution of the LP relaxation is integer and feasible
we have found the optimal solution. → STOP (There cannot exist a
solution with a better solution value.)

Assumption: Minimization problem
1 While not processed B&B nodes (subproblem) exist, choose one
2 Solve LP-relaxation → solution x
′
leading to local lower bound L
3 If global primal bound smaller (better) than local lower bound or
(sub)problem unsolvable (infeasible) → reject subproblem → Bound, goto 1
4 If x
′
is fractional: choose a fractional variable xi and create two
(sub)problems in which xi
is fixed to 0 and to 1, resp. → Branch, goto (1)
5 If x
′
is integral: update global primal bound (feasible solution) →
(sub-)problem solved, goto 1
6 Output global primal bound
Remark (minimization problem)
local primal bounds can take the role of global primal bounds
lower bounds are valid only for instances in the subtree of the search tree

(Dual) lower bound L shown in blue.
Node 5 can be fathomed, because 15 is larger than the best solution found
so far; hence the subtree cannot contain a better feasible solution.

Separation Problem (informal)
Given: point x
′
and a class of linear constraints C
Find: at least one constraint from C which is violated at x
′ or prove
that no such constraint exists
Theorem (Gr¨otschel, Lovasz, Schrijver)
A linear optimization problem over a class of linear constraints C is
solvable in polynomial time if and only if the corrresponding separation
problem on C can be solved in polynomial time.

Branch on a fractional variable corresponds to adding two cutting planes
We get two subproblems and optimize those further, either by adding
additional cutting planes (CUT) or by branching (BRANCH)

Branch-and-Cut Methods
Branch-and-Cut Algorithm
1 Cut: Solve the current LP (possibly using cutting planes); the LP
consists of constraints of the LP-relaxation AND/OR of a set of any
other feasible linear constraints valid for the ILP solutions
2 Branch: Branch if the LP solution is not feasible and no violated
cutting planes are found
3 Exploit: Find feasible integral solution based on the fractional
solution (primal heuristic)
4 Bound: Fathom non-profitable subtrees in the branch-and-bound
search tree
5 Price: In the case that the number of variables is very large, we can
start with a subset only and add parts of them during optimization if
necessary → column generation → Branch-and-Cut-and-Price
Many possibilities for improvements ⇒ Algorithm Engineering
